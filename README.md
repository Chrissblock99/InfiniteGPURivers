This project aims to generate rivers on a procedurally generated terrain efficiently.
To achieve this the method desccribed in [this research paper](http://www.cescg.org/CESCG-2011/papers/TUBudapest-Jako-Balazs.pdf) is implemented and adapted to be 3x3 bounded.
Specifically the sediment transportation algorithm has been adapted to use pipes like water and thermal processes.
Credit also goes to [Stefan Gustavson AKA stegu](https://github.com/stegu) for the simplex noise implementation.
